# Aave Proof of Reserve Review Round 2

## Introduction

Sigma Prime was commercially engaged to perform a time-boxed security review of the Aave Proof of Reserve smart contracts, as part of the [Master Services Agreement](https://governance.aave.com/t/sigma-prime-security-assessment-services-for-aave/8518) established between Sigma Prime and the Aave DAO.
The review focused on the security aspects of the Solidity smart contracts.

project.

### Overview

The review covers an update to the Proof of Reserve functionality.
The review is targeted at commit [fd3163c](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proof-of-reserve/commit/fd3163c9053cb2b5aebfdff51fe4157e1133f234).

The core of the update the `ProofOfReserveExecutorV3` to set LTV for an asset to zero rather than disabling borrowing for all reserves.
Setting the LTV to zero will prevent users from borrowing using this asset as collateral.

### Scope

The scope of the review covers the following components:

- `AvaxBridgeWrapper.sol`
- `ProofOrReserveAggregator.sol`
- `ProofOfReserveExecutorBase.sol`
- `ProofOfReserveExecutorV2.sol`
- `ProofOfReserveExecutorV3.sol`
- `ProofOfReserveKeeper.sol`
- Integration of the contracts with `LendingPool` and `PoolConfigurator` for both Aave V2 and V3.

### Summary of Findings

One informational finding was found during the review.

## 1. INF: Interchanging `enableProofOfReserveFeed()` and `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()` May Cause An Invalid State.

In `ProofOfReserveAggregator.sol`, the functions `enableProofOfReserveFeed()` and `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()` may be called on existing feeds.

When `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()` is called it will update the values `_proofOfReserveList[asset]` and `_bridgeWrapperList[asset]`.
Since `enableProofOfReserveFeed()` only updates `_proofOfReserveList[asset]` any residual values stored in `_bridgeWrapperList[asset]` will be preserved.

The impact of this issue is seen in the function `areAllReservesBacked()` which may incorrectly use the residual bridge value for `totalSupplyAddress`.
This can be seen in line #100-102 of `ProofOfReserveAggregator.sol`.

```solidity
  address totalSupplyAddress = bridgeAddress != address(0)
    ? bridgeAddress
    : assetAddress;
```

**Recommendation**

Consider enforcing `_proofOfReserveList[asset] == address(0)` in both `enableProofOfReserveFeed()` and `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()`.
To update the feed it would require first calling `disableProofOfReserveFeed()` followed by either `enableProofOfReserveFeed()` or `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()`.

An alternative solution is to set `delete _bridgeWrapperList[asset]` in `enableProofofReserveFeed()`.
This will delete any residual values from previous calls to `enableProofOfReserveFeedWithBridgeWrapper()`.
